			<h2>Activities at UR</h2>
			<p>The University of Rochester Cinema Group (URCG) a student group of students that screens movies every Friday and Saturday night throughout the academic year. We show high definition digital films in Hoyt Auditorium, located on the River Campus. We show a mixture of popular movies between theater and DVD release as well as indie flicks and older films. It is easy to get involved in the club, and help bring movies to campus. We are always looking for suggestions for movies, and our meetings are open to all who wish to attend (Sundays at 2pm in Wilson Commons 122).</p>
	
			<p>UR Cinema Group has been a staple of the University of Rochester's community since 1970. The club's purpose is to publicly show movies from many genres varying from blockbusters to independent films, providing the campus with a positive and entertaining movie-going experience. We show our primary programming on Friday and Saturday evenings and also have free alternative programs (films which are co-sponsored with other campus organizations) on pre-scheduled weeknights.</p>
	
			<p>Outside of our film programming, we further seek to provide a fun and fulfilling environment for our members through weekly meetings to discuss film and other goings on, off-campus screenings, and social events such as our annual Oscar party.<br>Meetings are held every Sunday at 2 PM in Wilson Commons 122. Students are welcome to join at anytime; members gain admission to special events and a chance to earn the full size movie posters that are on display.</p>
