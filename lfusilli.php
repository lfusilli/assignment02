			<h2>About Louis</h2>
			<p>For many years I had planned on focusing on exclusively business and related areas while I was in college. I planned on using the “Rochester curriculum” to my advantage. But after a few months in Italy, I realized that there was so much more that I wanted to learn about Italian language, culture, and especially my family history. So I decided that I’d do a minor in addition to the business. Then of course there were 5 semesters here in Rochester. Then, in the Fall of 2017, I made it back to Italy because I really missed the place. By then all of my degree requirements were complete, so it was basically a free for all in Milan, save for an internship that I completed there at a very cool and innovative digital consulting firm. And now I am here in Rochester for my final semester, taking just one last class, and preparing for life beyond school.

			<h2>Job Experience</h2>
			<p>From 2013 to 2017, I worked at a place called the Young Entrepreneurs Academy. It is an educational non-profit organization headquartered right here in Rochester. The mission is to teach middle and high school students how to start their own real businesses. What started as a small afterschool program in this city in 2004 is now an international organization with about 100 locations in this country that has graduated thousands of young, entrepreneurially-minded students. And the entire thing is run right here in Rochester, which I always thought was pretty cool. I started working there in high school as an intern, and then was hired as a part-time employee, which I was all throughout most of college. Last summer, after about 4 years, I decided it was time to move on. I knew I would be leaving the country soon for study abroad, and I also recognized that it would be important to do something else as an undergraduate. So then when I was in Italy last semester I was working at a firm called Partners4Innovation. And it was the most fulfilling and memorable work experience I think I’ll ever have.</p>

			<h2>Coding Experience</h2>
			<p>Although computer science is not my area of expertise, I have taken both CSC161 and CSC170 in the past, so I am somewhat familiar with Java and Python, and then very familiar with the basics of web design including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and more.</p>

			<h2>Activities at UR</h2>
			<p>Being a part-time student, I unfortunately don't have time for many extracurriculars that I once did. At one point, I served as a legislative advisor to the student government and worked in both the university's study abroad and minority student affairs office. Now, my sole responsibility is the layout and design chair for the Journal of Undergraduate Research. Our organization compiles and prints a semesterly journal that showcases the best research papers from UR students in any department. Our journals are on display in most department offices and waiting rooms all throughout the river campus and medical center.</p>
