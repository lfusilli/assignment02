			<h2>About German</h2>
			<p>I originally entered the University of Rochester as an engineering major, due to my talents in mathematics and art. I took PSY 101 my first semester, as I was very interested in pursuing psychology as a minor. I declared my Psychology major sophomore year.</p>

			<p>While my sister and I were both born in this country, my parents were born in different countries. My mother is Colombian and my father is Dominican. Living in a diverse neighborhood of the most diverse borough of New York City, I felt far from alienated for being a child of immigrant parents and for having parents who struggled with English.</p>
			
			<h2>Job Experience</h2>
			<p>My favorite place that I have volunteered with is a non-profit that offers services to senior citizens in New York City. I first started volunteering there in high school during the summer, then for some weekends and breaks throughout the school year, and volunteered for 7 months before the start of this past fall semester. I have worked at multiple of their luncheon centers and offices, with a wide variety of work.</p>
			
			<p>I have packaged cold lunches, delivered meals by foot, helped deliver pantry food, set tables, served hot lunches, cleaned and organized dishes and silverware, wiped down tables, taught private computer lessons, printed labels, copied documents, organized documents in folders, organized folders in filing cabinet, edited and updated spreadsheets, created new spreadsheet and organized data, entered data into databases, greeted guests at reception, answered and transferred incoming calls from reception desk, and translated volunteer manuals into Spanish.</p>

			<h2>Coding Experience</h2>
			<p>For my first role, I thought it would be best to start in a role best suited to my abilities. From the CSC170 course, I have experience with coding in CSS; experience that will aid my design choices.</p>

			<p>I look forward to working with my future group on our first project together and wish the rest of the class luck.</p>

			<h2>Activities at UR</h2>
			<p>German is interedted in art and is the Public Relations chair on two different e-boards.</p>
